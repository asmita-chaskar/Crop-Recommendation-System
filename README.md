# What-Crop-To-Grow
# Goal
## To recommend optimum crops to be cultivated by farmers based on several parameters and help them make an informed decision before cultivation.

## About Data
The data used in this project is made by augmenting and combining various publicly available datasets of India like weather, soil, etc. You can access the dataset here. This data is relatively simple with very few but useful features unlike the complicated features affecting the yield of the crop.
The data have Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Pottasium and pH values of the soil. Also, it also contains the humidity, temperature and rainfall required for a particular crop.


## Importing libraries
1) Pandas --- pip install pandas
2) matplotlib --- pip install matplotlib
3) sklearn --- pip install scikit-learn
4) pickle ----- pip install pickle

# So here comes the fun part
I have also made a GUI application using Tkinter library. You can view it in same repository.
